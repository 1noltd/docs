};

Slots allow you to nest other components as React code within your Studio UI components.  You can use slots to create dynamically generated children, like Comments on a Post, or to replace a child element altogether.

## Adding a slot
First, you'll need a component.  
1. Log into Amplify and [navigate to Studio](/console/adminui/start/).

2. On the left-hand navigation bar, click UI Library

3. Select a Figma component from your UI Library that you've imported into Studio.  
*If you don't have any Figma components already, you can start with [Amplify's Figma UI file](/console/uibuilder/figmatocode/).*

4. Configure that component by clicking the Configure button in the upper right-hand corner.

![Open your slot and click the gear icon to configure](/images/console/slots-console1.gif)

Next, you'll add a slot to this component.  
1. On the left-hand side, you'll see the Elements of your component.  Select a Figma Frame (![Figma frame icon](/images/console/figma-frame-icon.png)) within your component.  

  In this example, the "Area" frame is selected.

2. On the right-hand bar action bar, click the "Convert to a slot" button.  This will add a new component under the "Component properties" header.

3. Optionally, change your your property name.  

  In this example, the property has been renamed "comments"

<Callout warning>

Want to undo your slot creation?  

Locate your slot in the Component properties, click the triple-dot icon, and click "Erase property" to remove the slot.

</Callout>

## Importing your component
Once you've added a slot to your component, click the "Get component code" button at the bottom of the screen to see instructions on the next steps.  
1. Copy the `amplify pull` command, and run it in your Terminal
2. Copy the import code and paste it in your App.js file
3. Lastly, render the component by calling it in JSX

```jsx
/*Import your component*/
import { 
  Ampligram 
} from './ui-components'

function App() {
  return (
    /*Add your component below*/
    <div style={styles.post}>
      <Ampligram  /> 
    </div>
  );
}

const styles = {
  post: { width: 400, margin: '0 auto', padding: 20},
}

export default App;

```

Here's how the code above would render in your app.  Some minor styling has been added to help with visibility.

## Using your slot
To use the slot, pass a child component as a property of the parent component, using the prop name you picked earlier.  Then, the content you pass will be rendered as a child of the component.  


````jsx
import { 
  Ampligram 
} from '.ui-components'

function App() {
  return (
    <div style={styles.post}>
      <h1>Simple Slot Children</h1>
      <Ampligram comments={
        /* Pass your content into the slot */
        <div style={styles.comment}> 
          <h1>Hi mom!</h1>
          <p>Thanks for checking out my app</p>
        </div>
      }/>
    </div>
  );
}

const styles = {
  post: { width: 400, margin: '0 auto', padding: 20},
  comment: { paddingLeft: 30, textAlign: 'left'},
}

export default App;

````

Here's how the code above would render in your app.  We've added a little more styling to the comments to help with display.

## Adding slots to collections
Any component can be [converted to a collection](/console/uibuilder/collections/) and bound to data, and that includes components with slots.  With a collection, you can [extend your component via code](/console/uibuilder/override/) using the `overrideItems` prop to generate unique content within each component slot.  

Here, we have our Ampligram collection mapped to a data model called Post.  The Post model has a field called Comment, which contains an array of all the Comments associated with this Post.  We are then mapping the Comments for this Post to the "comments" slot we created.  

Creating dynamic child components is where Slots get very useful - you can even [pass another collection](/console/uibuilder/override/#nesting-collections) into this slot. 

The code below will render an Ampligram for each Post in the AmpligramCollection.  Then, the Comments for each Post will render in the "comments" slot.  

In this example, the first Post has 2 comments, but the second post has none.

```jsx
import { 
  AmpligramCollection 
} from './ui-components'

function App() {
  return (
    <div style={styles.post}>
      <h1>Dynamic Slot Children</h1>
      <AmpligramCollection overrideItems={({ item }) => ({
        comments: 
        <div style={styles.post}>
          {item.Comments.map(comment => <div>{comment.content}</div>)}
        </div>
      })} />
    </div>
  );
}

const styles = {
  post: { width: 400, margin: '0 auto', padding: 20},
  comment: { paddingLeft: 30, textAlign: 'left'},
}

export default App;
```
