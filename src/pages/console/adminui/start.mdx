AWS Amplify Studio is a visual development environment for building fullstack web and mobile apps. To learn more, see the [Amplify Studio introduction](/console/).

Amplify Studio is available in the following regions: [Amplify Studio service endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/amplify.html#amplifyadmin_region).

## Get started without an AWS account

If you are new to AWS, you don't need an AWS account to get started. Visit the [Amplify Studio Sandbox](https://sandbox.amplifyapp.com/), where you can build and test your data model, and build React forms, all without logging into AWS.

## Get started with your AWS account

If you already have an AWS account, you can begin using all of Amplify Studio's features. After you deploy a backend in Amplify, you can launch Studio from your Amplify project. Your entire team can use Studio to add new features, update app data, and manage users and groups.

### New Amplify project
To start using Studio, create a new project in Amplify
<InternalLinkButton href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home?#/deploy-backend">
  <span slot="text">Create New Project</span>
</InternalLinkButton>

Next, follow these steps to deploy and launch Amplify Studio:
1. Enter a name for your app and choose **Confirm deployment**. 
1. After your app deployment is complete, select the **Backend environments** tab.
1. Select **Launch Studio**. This automatically launches Amplify Studio in a new tab.

### Log into Studio
If you have an existing Amplify project with Studio already provisioned, you can log into Studio via the following steps:
1. Navigate to the [AWS Amplify Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home)
1. Select your app from the list of apps
1. Select the **Backend environments** tab
1. Select **Launch Studio**

### Add Studio to an existing project
If you create a new Amplify project through the CLI, Studio will need to be activated before it can be launched. Use the following steps:
1. Navigate to the [AWS Amplify Console]("https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home")
1. Select your app from the list of apps
1. Select the **Backend environments** tab
1. Select **Set up Amplify Studio**
1. Toggle **Enable Amplify Studio** from Off to On
1. After Studio has been successfully provisioned, navigate back your app's information page
1. Select **Launch Studio** to open Studio in a new browser tab
