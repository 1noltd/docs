Amplify Studio enables customers to build React forms based on their backend data model, JSON payload shape, or completely from scratch. (TK)

## Build a new form

To build a new form, go to **Amplify Studio** > **UI Library** > **Forms (new)**. 
1. Enter the **Form name** - the form name needs to be PascalCase. The form name is also used as the component name, when you pull the form component to your local development environment. (TK)
2. Select **form type**:
  - **Create**: By default, the form is completely blank.
  - **Update**: By default, the form expect you to pass in an existing record to pre-populate the form inputs with an existing value.
3. Choose a starting point:
  - **Blank**: Start from a blank slate. Add form inputs and, optionally, deploy a matching cloud database later.
  - **Data model**: Generate a form based on an existing data model. Form inputs are inferred based on the data model's field names and types.
  - **JSON object**: Generate a form based on a sample JSON object that you'd like the form to produce. Form inputs are inferred based on the JSON object's field names and types.

## Auto-generate forms based on data model

Amplify Studio can auto-generate form component for every data model in your Amplify project. These auto-generated forms are kept in-sync with updates to your data model as well.

For example, if you deploy a **Home** data model with "address" and "price" fields, Amplify Studio automatically creates a "HomeCreateForm" and a "HomeUpdateForm" for you. If you deploy an update to the data model by adding a "description" field, then text input called "Description" is automatically added to the "HomeCreateForm" and "HomeUpdateForm" as well. (TK)
