Amplify Studio's Form Builder automatically generates cloud-connected forms as React code, either from your data model definitions, or from scratch. You can configure validation logic, adjust theming, and customize presentation all within the console. 

Forms are also extensible, allowing full form lifecycle management, and supporting custom validation logic in code, including calling an external API or validating against another database.

## Auto-Generated Forms

The fastest and easiest way to use Amplify Form Builder is to use forms generated from your data model. To auto-generate forms:

1. Deploy a data model in Amplify Studio - [Learn more](data/data-model/)
2. Navigate to the **Studio Console > UI Library**

Your forms will be listed on the left-hand nav bar under the **Forms** header

![Studio console showing auto-generated forms on the left-hand navigation bar](/images/console/formbuilder/overview1.png)

<Callout info>

**Missing Forms?**

If you have a deployed data model, but have no forms, automatic form generation may be disabled. 

In the upper right-hand corner of the UI Library, select **UI Library settings**, and enable **Automatic form creation**

</Callout>

For each model in your data schema, Amplify Studio will generate two forms: a **Create** form, and an **Update** form. 

Your forms will contain inputs for each field in your data model. Auto-generated forms are dynamic; as your data model changes, the forms' fields will update accordingly.

### Customizing Auto-Generated Forms

You can customize the style and presentation of your auto-generated forms in a number of ways. To make changes to a form:

1. Navigate to **Studio Console > UI Library**
2. In the left-hand nav bar, select your form
3. In the upper right-hand corner, select **Configure**

Here, you can make a number of modifications to your form. 

- Select any input element to customize its attributes, like labels and placeholder values
- Drag input elements to re-order them on your form, or set elements left-to-right to make rows
- Select your **Submit**, **Cancel**, and **Clear** buttons to customize them
- Adjust the spacing around and between input elements using the top bar

>Pro tip: you can use theme tags, like xs and xxl, or discrete values with units, like 150 px

Once you are satisfied with your form, select **View as end user** to see and interact with your form as it would appear to a customer. Select **Back to edit** to continue customizing your form.

**Fully Functional Forms**

When you select **View as end user**, you are interacting with a fully functional form!

Select **Submit** to actually create or update records in your data schema.

</Callout>

## Build a Basic Custom Form

Alternatively, Amplify Studio allows you to build forms completely from scratch. To generate a basic, brand-new form:

1. Navigate to **Studio Console > UI Library**
2. In the left-hand nav bar, next to the **Forms** header, select **New**
3. Give your form a name, leave the other options as default, and click **Create form**

![New form page, showing the options available when creating a new form](/images/console/formbuilder/overview2.png)

You will be directed to the Form Creation page. Select the **plus sign**, and select an input element to add to your form.

### Customizing input elements

Like inputs in auto-generated forms, each input element can be customized to fit your needs. 

All input elements allow you to customize their label, and some input elements have unique customization options, like default values, placeholder values, and even allowing multiple values. Explore different inputs to build the right form for your needs.

### Basic validation

Validation rules prevent your form from accepting unwanted input from users. Form Builder contains three types of validation:

- **Automatic Validation**: Some fields, like `EmailField` and `IPAddressField`, have built-in validation.   *[learn more]()*
- **Validation Rules**: You can add validation rules using the **Add rule** button in the Validation rules menu.   *[learn more]()*
- **Custom Validation**: You can use events in your form's lifecycle to trigger custom validation in code.   *[learn more]()*

## Using Your Forms

### Initial Setup

To use a form in your application, you first need to configure your project to use Amplify Studio generated components. 

1. Navigate to your application's root directory and install the following npm dependencies

```
npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli
```

```
npm install aws-amplify @aws-amplify/ui-react
```

2. In your application's `index.js` file, add the following imports and configuration

```jsx
import {ThemeProvider} from "@aws-amplify/ui-react";
import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';
import awsconfig from './aws-exports';
import "@aws-amplify/ui-react/styles.css";
import studioTheme from './ui-components/studioTheme';
Amplify.configure(awsconfig);
```
3. In your application's `index.js` file, wrap the `<App />` with the following:

```jsx
<ThemeProvider theme={studioTheme}>
    <App />
</ThemeProvider>
```

### Import and Render Your Form

Next, your forms need to be pulled from the Amplify cloud to your project, and imported into your code. 

1. Navigate to your application's root directory and run `amplify pull`
2.
