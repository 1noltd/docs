When you need leverage S3's transfer accelaration on the content bucket, you can override the storage resource for this configuration and then leveraging the `useAccelerateEndpoint` parameter to use the accelarated S3 endpoint. This will enable fast, easy, and secure transfers of files over long distances between your client and the S3 bucket.

## Override storage resource

Start by overriding storage resource to enable Transfer Accelaration on the content bucket.

```sh
$ amplify override storage
✅ Successfully generated "override.ts" folder at <project>/amplify/backend/storage/accelarated-bucket
✔ Do you want to edit override.ts file now? (Y/n) · yes
Edit the file in your editor: <project>/amplify/backend/storage/accelarated-bucket/override.ts
```

In the generated `override.ts` file use the following CDK snippet to enable transfer accelaration. 

```typescript
// amplify/backend/storage/accelarated-bucket/override.ts
import { AmplifyS3ResourceTemplate } from '@aws-amplify/cli-extensibility-helper';

export function override(resources: AmplifyS3ResourceTemplate) {
    resources.s3Bucket.accelerateConfiguration = {
        accelerationStatus: 'Enabled'
    }
}
```

Next, deploy this storage resource:

```sh
amplify push
```



## Use below snippet for leveraging accelarated endpoint

While using the Storage.put method, we use the `useAccelerateEndpoint` parameter to use the accelarated S3 endpoint.

```javascript
const result = await Storage.put("test.txt", "Hello", {
    useAccelerateEndpoint: true // use accelarated S3 endpoint
});
```
