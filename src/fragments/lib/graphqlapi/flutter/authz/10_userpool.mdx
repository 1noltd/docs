In case you have not added the Cognito libraries to your application, be sure to add them:

```yaml
 environment:
   sdk: ">=2.17.3 <3.0.0"

 dependencies:
   flutter:
     sdk: flutter

   amplify_flutter: ^0.5.1
   amplify_api: ^0.5.1
   # Be sure that this is added
   amplify_auth_cognito: ^0.5.1
```

Afterwards add the following code to your app before you configure Amplify:

```dart
await Amplify.addPlugins([AmplifyAuthCognito(), AmplifyAPI()]);
```
