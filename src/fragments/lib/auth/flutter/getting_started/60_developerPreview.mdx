<Callout warning>

Web and desktop support for the Amplify Flutter Auth category is now in developer preview!  See the documentation for [project setup](/lib/project-setup/create-application) and the [Auth category](/lib/auth/getting-started) for more information about web and desktop support.

We will be adding support for additional categories on a rolling basis.

The developer preview release is not intended for production usage. Cached credentials for users who have already logged in on existing applications will not be used by the developer preview.
