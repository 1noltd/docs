Web and desktop support for the Amplify Flutter Auth category is now in developer preview!  See the documentation for [project setup](/lib/project-setup/create-application) and the [Auth category](/lib/auth/getting-started) for more information about web and desktop support.

We will be adding support for additional categories on a rolling basis.

The developer preview release is not intended for production usage.
