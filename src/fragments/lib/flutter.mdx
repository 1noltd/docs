Web and Desktop support for the Amplify Flutter Auth category is now in developer preview! To give it a try, install it from <<INSERT PUB VERSION>>. You will find instructions for using the developer preview throughout the documentation.

We will be adding support for additional categories on a rolling basis.

The developer preview release is not intended for production usage.
