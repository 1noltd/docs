An existing Amazon S3 bucket can be used with the Amplify Libraries by referencing it in your `amplifyconfiguration.dart` file.

```dart
const amplifyconfig = ''' {
  "UserAgent": "aws-amplify-cli/2.0",
  "Version": "1.0",
  "storage": {
    "plugins": {
      "awsS3StoragePlugin": {
        "bucket": "[BUCKET NAME]",
        "region": "[REGION]"
      }
    }
  }
}''';
```

- **bucket**: Name of the bucket to use for storage
- **region**: AWS Region where the bucket is provisioned (e.g. *us-east-1*)

<Callout warning>

Using existing Amazon S3 bucket may require configuring bucket access permissions. e.g. Enabling read/write access to the cognito user pool that you are using with the Amplify Auth category.
