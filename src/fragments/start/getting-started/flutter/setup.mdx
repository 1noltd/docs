## Set up your application

### Create a new Flutter application

Create a new project using Flutter CLI:

```bash
flutter create amplified_todo
```

import flutter0 from '/src/fragments/start/getting-started/flutter/flutter-platform-setup/ios-setup-mdx';
import flutter1 from '/src/fragments/start/getting-started/flutter/flutter-platform-setup/android-setup-mdx';


### Add Amplify to your application

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="Stable">

Amplify for Flutter is distributed via [pub.dev](pub.dev).

1. From your project root directory, find and modify pubspec.yaml and add the Amplify plugins to the project dependencies.

    ```yaml
    environment:
      sdk: ">=2.15.0 <3.0.0"

    dependencies:
      flutter:
        sdk: flutter

      amplify_flutter: ^0.6.0
      amplify_datastore: ^0.6.0
    ```

2. Install the dependencies by running the following command. Depending on your development environment, you may perform this step via your IDE (or it may even be performed for you automatically).

    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

<Fragments fragments={{ flutter: flutter0 }} />
<Fragments fragments={{ flutter: flutter1 }} />


</BlockSwitcher>
</Block>

import flutter1 from '/src/fragments/start/getting-started/flutter/kotlin-version-warning.mdx';

<Fragments fragments={{ flutter: flutter1 }} />

You are ready to start building with Amplify! 🎉
