Web and Desktop support for the Amplify Flutter Auth category is now in developer preview! To give it a try, install it from INSERT PUB VERSION. You will find instructions for using the developer preview throughout this guide.

We will be adding support for additional categories on a rolling basis.

The developer preview release is not intended for production usage.

This tutorial guides you through setting up a backend and integrating that backend with your web app. You will create a fully featured Todo app using Amplify DataStore to store and retrieve items in a cloud database, as well as receive updates over a realtime subscription.

This tutorial also assumes you have at least a working knowledge of [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) basics.

What you will do:



* Set up a Flutter application configured with Amplify
* Create a data model and persist data to Amplify DataStore
* Connect your local data to synchronize to a cloud backend
